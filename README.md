Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

In this course from Freshman Fall 2017, I learned about different abstract data types, data structures, and a few sorting algorithms.  The data structures included but aren't limited to: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (and other types of trees such as self-balancing, 2-3, etc), sets, maps, hash tables and graphs. I analyzed the runtime and space complexity of different algorithms run on data structures. I also created Java programs utilizing good software practices such as debugging, interfaces, and modularity.
